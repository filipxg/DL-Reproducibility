# DL-Reproducibility

The following repo tries to reproduce Figure 2 of the paper [3D convolutional neural networks-based segmentation to acquire quantitative criteria of the nucleus during mouse embryogenesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-020-00152-8), in which the [[blog.md]] file is a blog post discussing the steps taken in reproducing the work from the paper. 

We produced 2 models that try to reproduce the figure, namely QCANet and 3D U-Net. To try to make an accurate reproduction, we constructed and trained the models separately from what the paper did, this lead to various difficulties which are explained in the blog post.
